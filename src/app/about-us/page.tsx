    I wasnâ€™t always a designer. Previously, I worked for large tech companies as a marketing manager.

    In 2019, I quit my job, and became a self-taught freelance designer.

    I spent around 3 years freelancing, mostly designing & building Webflow websites & Shopify online stores. The thing I liked about freelancing was the opportunity to help small businesses.

    In 2021 I started working as a Sr. Product Designer at Sweatcoin, a mobile app that rewards users for walking. I was in the Growth Team, where my main focus was design with the goal of user acquisition. My marketing background was particularly useful here. During my time there we gained 80M+ new users.

    Since 2022, I've been teaching UI & Product Design at Dribbble and mentoring designers at Liftyz.

    Heart Icon | Good Design I love good design, photography, wine, travel, sports, languages and books.
